Ore Generator recoded.

This is a plugin created for the sake of replacing a similar one that having a backdoor feature that gives player * permissiion when typing commands.
Contribution is appriciated, the only difference with other Ore Generator plugin is that this one could combine with Fence + Lava/Water to make a generator.
