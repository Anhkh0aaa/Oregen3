Ore Generator recoded.

This is a plugin created for the sake of replacing a similar one having a backdoor feature that gives player * permission when typing commands.
Contribution is appreciated, the only difference with other Ore Generator plugin is that this one could combine Block + Flowing blocks to make a generator.
