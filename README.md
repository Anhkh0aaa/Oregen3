Ore Generator recoded.

This is a plugin created for the sake of replacing a similar one having a backdoor feature that gives player * permission when typing commands.
Contribution is appreciated, the only difference with other Ore Generator plugin is that this one could combine Block + Flowing blocks to make a generator.

# Configuration File
 [Link](https://github.com/xHexed/Oregen3/blob/master/src/main/resources/config.yml)

# How to download the jar file
* [Head to the Actions page](https://github.com/xHexed/Oregen3/actions) 
* Click the first workflow (or any workflow that succeeded with green tick)
* Click the artifact (yes the text itself), it should download the zip file contains the jar file for you.
* And yes its a bit bleeding-edge cuz manual testing sooooo.....
