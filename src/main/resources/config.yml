# -------------------------------------
# Configuration instruction is here
# https://github.com/xHexed/Oregen3/blob/master/src/main/resources/config.yml
# Please click if you use the plugin the first time or updating
# Notes:
#  enableDependency: it will try to find a skyblock plugin to enable the owner permission feature
#  sound: you can use the old enum sound, as long as it playable in your version (ex: 1.8 sound for 1.12 server)
#  Avalable placeholder for messages:
#  - missingArgs: %format%
#  - noPermission: %perm%
#  - noPlayer: %player%
#  - noIslandOthers: %player%
#  - messages:
#     commands: %label% (First argument in command)
#  hooks:
#   BentoBox:
#    gamemodePriorities:
#     - This plugin will check for avalable gamemode by order. If witch addon comes first then it will use that gamemode to check
#       for player's island (who knows someone would use 2 gamemode at a time....)
#     - Since BentoBox lets you install many Gamemodes, this check is required due to the fact this plugin only hooks into one
#       gamemode.
#     - If an invaild gamemode is found, the plugin will skip it.
# Tips:
#  You can use PlaceholderAPI or MVDWPlaceholderAPI placeholder
#  in every messages (execpt some that requires a player but the message can't get the player's name)
